# Donate

Droid-ify is a free and open-source project that anyone can use free of charge, but as the principal developer of the project, I put a lot of time and effort into developing it. By donating, your support will help me keep working on projects for everyone to enjoy freely. Please consider making a donation if you like Droid-ify! ðŸ™‚

Because updating and maintaining the project is an ongoing process, recurring donations are the best way to support me and my development. They help me offer sustainable support in the long term. If you canâ€™t afford it, thatâ€™s okay â€” you can still support me with a one-time donation. It doesnâ€™t help as much with sustainable support, but all support is appreciated. Donâ€™t worry if you think itâ€™s not enough!
