# Donate

Droid-ify is a free and open-source project that anyone can use free of charge, but as the principal developer of the project, I put a lot of time and effort into developing it. By donating, your support will help me keep working on projects for everyone to enjoy freely. Please consider making a donation if you like Droid-ify! ðŸ™‚

Because updating and maintaining the project is an ongoing process, recurring donations are the best way to support me and my development. They help me offer sustainable support in the long term. If you canâ€™t afford it, thatâ€™s okay â€” you can still support me with a one-time donation. It doesnâ€™t help as much with sustainable support, but all support is appreciated. Donâ€™t worry if you think itâ€™s not enough!

## Recurring Donations

### Patreon (recommended)

The best way to support me and my development is by pledging on [Patreon](https://patreon.com/iamlooker). With a monthly pledge, youâ€™ll get access to many benefits for your support, all the while helping me keep making great things for everyone to enjoy:

- [Early access to updates and new features](https://patreon.com/iamlooker)
- Behind-the-scenes development insights
- Polls for updates and features to prioritize
- Priority support

### Liberapay

If you prefer to support my development while remaining completely anonymous, you can start a recurring donation on [Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/iamlooker). While I can't offer specific benefits through Liberapay, I appreciate your support!

### PayPal (recurring)

You can also make a recurring monthly donation with [PayPal Donations](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=YOUR_BUTTON_ID) if you prefer. Unfortunately, I can't offer benefits through this method.

## One-time Donations

### PayPal (one-time)

If you'd like to make a one-time donation, you can use [PayPal](https://paypal.me/iamlookerdonate) for the easiest and quickest option.

If you don't have a PayPal account, you can still donate directly with a credit or debit card using [PayPal Donations](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=YOUR_BUTTON_ID).

### UPI

Please consider using a low fee for cryptocurrency donations, as they are not time-critical, and transaction fees can be high for some currencies.

Thank you for your support of Droid-ify!
